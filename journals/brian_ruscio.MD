## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Today was a good step as the team and I developed a way for a user to create an account on the front end with a form. I was the driver today and used my past knowledge on react along with what we have developed in the database, to allow our users to create their own profiles.
