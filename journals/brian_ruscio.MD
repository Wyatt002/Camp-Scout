## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

Today we worked through establishing a connection to the SQL Database and being able to view some of the Data we created. The team ran into some bugs when setting up docker but they were eventually resolved for each member.

Today was a good step as the team and I developed a way for a user to create an account on the front end with a form. I was the driver today and used my past knowledge on react along with what we have developed in the database, to allow our users to create their own profiles.
