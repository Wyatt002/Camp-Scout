 - Getting docker.yaml file complete and docker up and running with Connor, Brian J, and Brian R.
I bulilt the dockler.yaml and migration tables, we worked together to make updates and bugs before finally deploying.
We had some issues with docker containers but resolved the issue for each member.

6/28
 - Getting our authenticator/authentication working
 - finished our SQL tables
I built most of the authenticator before we had Brian R share his screen as we tried to get our auth working as a group.
We ran into a blocker as we had several errors that we couldn't resolve and by the end of the day we didn'y get our Auth done.

Our tables and getting them to display in pg admin.

Brain J noticed we were missing a router pathe for our Token and was able to get our Auth working!
Connor started messing with pytests.

 - Signing up on the frontend.
We began adding a sign up on our frontend. when making the account it has the user input their email, first
name, last name, a password and a confirmation of that password to verify it matches with the entered password.
We successfully got our sign up working!

7/11
 - We began wokring on our login on our frontend.
Today was a stump we ran into errors attempting to implament our login page but kept running into an issue involving an 'invalid <!DOCTYPE>' and are unsure what is causing it.

7/12
 - Login on frontend.
Figured out the 'invalid <!DOCTYPE>' issue we were running into and found out it was bc we were forgetting to include the 'baseUrl' in the 'App.js', the rest
of our code was perfectly fine and did it jobs perfectly, allowing us to login with any users that existed within our database.

7/13 and 7/14
 Brian R and I began to work on the main page and nav of our frontend
