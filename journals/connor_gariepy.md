Today, I worked on:

* Getting our branches merged to have the same docker-compose.yaml and migrations

Today we worked as a group making sure everyone's containers were properly running
after a little struggle of having to 'npm install' our package.json again, and
that our campscout_db was working properly.  We tested to make sure that we could
both 'SELECT' and 'INSERT INTO' our tables and we were able to successfully
populate them and view their contents.
