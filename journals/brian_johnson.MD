Today, I worked on:

* Getting docker.yaml file complete and docker up and running with Connor, Jennifer, and Brian R.

Jennifer composed docker.yaml file and migrations file.  We reviewed together and made some
minor updates before deploying.

We all ran into docker issues with GHI and fastAPI containers.  Resolved GHI issue by reinstalling nodes.
Also, had to delete migration file in api/pycache.

Today, I worked on:

* Worked with team to implement authentication.   I noticed the accounts.py did not have the router.get for "token".  I implemented and updated classes.

Once revised I was able to get the authenticator to work!
