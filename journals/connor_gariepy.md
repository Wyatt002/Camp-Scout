Today we began to work on:

* Finalized our SQL tables
* Getting our authenticator/authentication working

Today we worked together as a group with Brian R sharing his screen as we tried to
get our authenticator to worked.  We played around with it for awhile and managed
to work out several errors that were inhibiting our progress but we weren't able
to get it working by the end of the day.

We did however finalize and test our data tables, happy with the columsn we created
for it we were able to successfully use 'SELECT' and 'INSERT INTO' to both view and
populate them.

Today, I worked on:

* Getting our branches merged to have the same docker-compose.yaml and migrations

Today we worked as a group making sure everyone's containers were properly running
after a little struggle of having to 'npm install' our package.json again, and
that our campscout_db was working properly.  We tested to make sure that we could
both 'SELECT' and 'INSERT INTO' our tables and we were able to successfully
populate them and view their contents.
