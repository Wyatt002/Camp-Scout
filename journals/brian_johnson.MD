Today, I worked on:

* Getting docker.yaml file complete and docker up and running with Connor, Jennifer, and Brian R.

Jennifer composed docker.yaml file and migrations file.  We reviewed together and made some
minor updates before deploying.

We all ran into docker issues with GHI and fastAPI containers.  Resolved GHI issue by reinstalling nodes.
Also, had to delete migration file in api/pycache.
